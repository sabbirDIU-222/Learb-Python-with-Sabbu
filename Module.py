# in module i learn a very cool things
# that is
 # in our project we can have a method that we need in different file
 # so in java we use aggregation or extend any class
 # but in python i hear that we can do it in module
 # we keeep our file name and use dot operator to call its method



'''
    now suppose our module file have a method named
    eating function
    so we make another file and acccess this eating method
'''

def eating():
    print("sabbu eat rui fish and chicken roast")


'''import Module
import random
Module.eating()

x = random.randrange(1,1000)
print(x)'''

# so this is , using module we can also access the global variable in our file
# let's suppose we have some global variable

number = 23
name ="shimul"
'''
print(Module.name)
print(Module.number)

'''

# now we taste it using a dictionary or hash map

# make a dictionary

classmate = {
    "moti" : "self fish",
    "ibrahim": " imposter",
    "mamun":" heart kinded but slow self fish",
    "ridwan" : "fotka",


}


# build in module
# as like random we can import as many module we want
# there are lots of module in our python library
